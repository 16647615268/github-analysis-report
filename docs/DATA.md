# Data Description

## Data Source

The data source of this project mainly comes from [GH Archive](https://www.gharchive.org/) which is a project to record the public GitHub timeline, archive it and make it easily accessible for further analysis. 



## Database

In order to meet the requirement for high-speed analysis among such big data, we parse the row data into well-defined structure and import it into [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.tech/) server which is an open source column-oriented database management system capable of real time generation of analytical data reports using SQL queries. The Clickhouse database version is 20.5.2.7 in our server.
